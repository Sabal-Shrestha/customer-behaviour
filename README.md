# Analysing customer behaviour using transaction data

Repository for the project "Analysing customer behaviour using transaction data".

Short overview
- Combine behavioral cohort analysis (RFM, time-based cohorts) with predictive models (churn, next-purchase, short-term CLTV).

Quick start
1. Create and activate a Python environment (Python 3.9+).

2. Install dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run exploratory scripts/notebooks in `notebooks/` or scripts in `scripts/`.

Data
- Place the transaction CSV at `data/transaction-dataset.csv` (this file is intentionally gitignored).
